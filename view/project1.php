  <h3>Project Brief</h3>
    <p>An application I have done as my final task on the IT course I attended.</p>
    <p>It is a website for chocolate lovers where they can find facts about chocolate, and yummy recipes. There are two users: an ordinary user must register in order to see the content; an administrator adds and removes categories and recipes, and also adds or removes comments.</p>
